### System2

`System2` is a cross-platform c library that allows you to call shell commands and other executables (subprocess), just like `system` but with the ability to
provide input to stdin and capture the output from stdout and stderr.

> [!NOTE]
> ### What's new?
>
> Added new function: `System2RunSubprocess()` which allows you to launch other executables
>
> Added option to choose to use stdin/stdout or redirect them back to the caller
>
> Added option to set the directory of the command being run

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Breaking change from 21st June 2024.
> 
> Inputs and Outputs of the command are now using **stdin and stdout by default** instead of being redirected by default.
> 
> To retain previous behavior, see the updated [Quick Start With Minimum running example (Without checks)](#quick-start-with-minimum-running-example-without-checks)

#### Features

- Written in C99, and is ready to be used in C++ as well
- Cross-platform (POSIX and Windows)
- Command interaction with stdin, stdout, and stderr
- Invoking shell commands and launching executables
- Blocking (sync) and non-blocking (async) version
- No dependencies (only standard C and system libraries).
    No longer need a heavy framework like boost or poco just to capture output from running a command.
- Header only library (source version available as well)
- UTF-8 support\*
- CMake integration

\* See Remarks for UTF-8 support

#### Quick Start With Minimum running example (Without checks)

```c
#include "System2.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) 
{
    System2CommandInfo commandInfo;
    memset(&commandInfo, 0, sizeof(System2CommandInfo));
    commandInfo.RedirectInput = true;
    commandInfo.RedirectOutput = true;

    #if defined(__unix__) || defined(__APPLE__)
        System2Run("read testVar && echo testVar is \\\"$testVar\\\"", &commandInfo);
    #endif
    
    #if defined(_WIN32)
        System2Run("set /p testVar= && echo testVar is \"!testVar!\"", &commandInfo);
    #endif
    
    char input[] = "test content\n";
    System2WriteToInput(&commandInfo, input, sizeof(input));
    
    //Waiting here simulates the child process has "finished" and we read the output of it
    //Sleep(2000);
    
    char outputBuffer[1024];
    uint32_t bytesRead = 0;
    
    //System2ReadFromOutput can also return SYSTEM2_RESULT_READ_NOT_FINISHED if we have more to read
    //In which case can use a do while loop to keep getting the output
    System2ReadFromOutput(&commandInfo, outputBuffer, 1023, &bytesRead);
    outputBuffer[bytesRead] = 0;
    
    int returnCode = -1;
    System2GetCommandReturnValueSync(&commandInfo, &returnCode);
    
    printf("%s\n", outputBuffer);
    printf("%s: %d\n", "Command has executed with return value", returnCode);
    
    return 0;
    
    //Output: Command has executed with return value: 0
    //Output: testVar is "test content"
}
```

#### Using System2 in your project

This library has header only version, just include "System2.h" and you are good to go.

However, this will leak system library headers to your codebase.

In that case, you can use the source version of the library.

1. Define `SYSTEM2_DECLARATION_ONLY 1` before including `System2.h`

2. Then, either:
    - Add `System2.c` to you codebase
    - Or include `System2.h` in a single c file and define `SYSTEM2_IMPLEMENTATION_ONLY 1` before it
    - Or link your project with `System2` target in CMake`

#### Remarks
- For POSIX, UTF-8 support should work if it is available on the system. This is however **not tested**.
- For Windows, UTF-8 support works for the **command** input (in theory XP and above but tested on Windows 10). 
    However, the output part is **NOT** in UTF-8. The closest thing you can get for the output is UTF-16 as far as I know.
    Here's what needed to get output in UTF-16:
    1. Instead of `System2Run("<your command>", &commandInfo)`, do `System2Run("cmd /u /s /v /c \"<your command>\"", &commandInfo)`
        This will output a UTF-16 string from cmd stdout/stderr
    2. Read output as usual from `System2ReadFromOutput` but interpret the output as wchar_t string instead.
        - You can then use `WideCharToMultiByte` to convert the output to UTF-8 if needed
    3. If you want to output the UTF-16 output to console, you need to use `_setmode` before calling `wprintf`/`printf`
        - See [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/setmode?view=msvc-170) for `_setmode` example
